✅Monthly revenue is stable but has occasional drops in June, September and November: Promotional campaigns could help boost sales during low-performing months.

✅Electronics has the the lowest revenue and offers least amount of low-rate discounts, while Clothing has the highest revenue and offers low-rate discounts most often. This suggests that small discounts(10-20%) can boost profits.

✅Credit Card is the most preferred payment method, followed by UPI and Debit Card.
